# jQuery

This is a javascript library that makes shorten and easier code for DOM.

[Here](https://jquery.com/download/) is the source to use jQuery in your project.

## In your code

Every time you write the code, you need to add this method

```js
   $(document).ready(function() {
      // code goes here
   });
```

This code will wait until the document loads and ready to start.

> And here is short way to write the exact same code.

```js
   $(function() {
      // code goes here
   });
```
